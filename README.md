#Refunds Extension

Native Refunds extension for CiviCRM is developing to make refunds and keep proper record of refund transactions.

There are two types of refunds supported by this extension:

* **User requested refunds:** User can request refund through this extension
* **Organization generated refunds:** Organization can also generate refund without user request.

This extension is compatible with offline payment like cash and check, user can request refund through a front-end public form with their email address and details about refund request regardless they made payment with either method but they will get their refund through offline payment mode like cash or check on approval of request by organization website admin.


Website admin can view, approve and reject user refunds requests, website admin can approve full refund without any processing fees or deduction and also can approve partial refunds with processing fees and deduction.


Website admin can also make refunds without user request with same parameters.


All details of refund transaction on approval or rejection will be sent to user through email.


All records of pending approved and rejected requests of refunds and user generated refund will be saved in the database for record.
